## Problem Statement

We are to answer questions that involve hydrophone data

7) In each site and for each category that you identified in step 3, plot 𝑃𝑆𝐷𝑑𝐵 vs frequency 

8) Compare the spectral levels and answer these questions:

a) What is the effect of wind and rain on underwater noise? Explain any behavior you observe in your result.

b) Which one has the highest impact? Rain or wind?

c) What are the main reasons for observing different spectral levels in Oregon shelf compared to Oregon offshore?

### Earthquakes Taking Place in April 2015

Here we can see that there are a number of earthquakes occurring along the lower divergent boundary and along the transform boundary. The majority of earthquakes in this month happened on day 24, counting around 12 total. According to a write up found on AGU Journals, it was stated that the 24th of April was the beginning of an eruption of the Axial Seamount location. These explosive events lasted until May. After the initial explosion, water temperatures in the area rose and maintained constant for around a week. 

## Solution - Part 2

### Identifying locations of divergent and transform boundaries

Below are the areas of divergent and transform boundaries that I selected for my analysis:

d) Along the divergent plate boundaries we notice lower magnitude earthquakes. According to cuny.edu this is because these divergent boundaries have more shallow siesmic activity. In an image on the site it is observed that only the lithosphere and crust move away from each other, while the asthenosphere remains dormant beneath. Less land mass moving would mean less energy released, resulting in less powerful earthquakes. Along the transform plate boundaries we notice higher magnitude and frequency of earthquake. According to the same source, it states that these boundaries are also shallow but involve very powerful earthquake responses. This may be due to the rubbing of landmass together, causing a higher amount of energy to be stored and released at a given time.
