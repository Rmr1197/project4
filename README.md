## Problem Statement

## Part 1 Wind and Rain Noise

We are to answer questions that involve hydrophone data

7) In each site and for each category that you identified in step 3, plot 𝑃𝑆𝐷𝑑𝐵 vs frequency 

8) Compare the spectral levels and answer these questions:

a) What is the effect of wind and rain on underwater noise? Explain any behavior you observe in your result.

b) Which one has the highest impact? Rain or wind?

c) What are the main reasons for observing different spectral levels in Oregon shelf compared to Oregon offshore?

## Part 2 Airgun, Marine Mammals, Earthquake/Volcano Noise

In this part, data can be at any time from any location listed in this link.

1) Find a short time period that there is a marine mammal vocalization in recorded data and plot its spectrogram.

2) Find a short time period that there is an airgun noise in recorded data and plot its spectrogram.

3) Find a short time period that there is an earthquake or a volcano eruption in recorded data and plot its spectrogram.

4) Compare the bandwidth of these three signals. Are they consistent with what is shown in the Wenz curve?

## Solution - Part 1

### 7) In each site and for each category that you identified in step 3, plot 𝑃𝑆𝐷𝑑𝐵 vs frequency

a) What is the effect of wind and rain on underwater noise? Explain any behavior you observe in your result.

Looking at the Oregon Shelf site, we can see that there are lower spectral levels at lower frequencies in cases where there is only rain or only wind. Looking at figures 10 and 11, we observe the range only going up to 108, instead of 120 where it does in the cases of either both wind and rain, or neither of the two, in figures 9 and 12. In a case of no wind and no rain, figure 9, we see that higher frequencies have a higher spectrum level, indicated by the brighter color.

b) Which one has the highest impact? Rain or wind?

In the Oregon Offshore site, during a period of wind and no rain, figure 15, we see the highest spectrum level for frequencies than any other site at any other period. We also notice that in figure 14, the lack of rain also shows a brighter color representing  higher spectral level. Cases of wind and rain, and no wind and no rain both look very similar in terms of spectral level at this site. 

c) What are the main reasons for observing different spectral levels in Oregon shelf compared to Oregon offshore?

The offshore site, as the name implies, is offshore. Sites further out can have deeper depths, and cause the sound to reflect less than sites further inshore.
